# MFL

MFL, 'My First Language', is a statically-typed scripting language built as an exercise to learn about programming languages. The TypeScript interpreter for the language is found here, as well as the files for the web playground.

Rather than reading about it, [try it now in your browser](https://glowbigger.github.io/mfl.html)!

## Building

Alternatively, you can build the language to run it in a terminal.
```bash
git clone 'https://github.com/glowbigger/mfl'
cd mfl
npm install
tsc
```

Then run
```bash
# run the interactive mode
npm run lang

# run a specific file
npm run lang <path>
```
